            While the scope of this project might not demand a full-fledged production infrastructure, I've implemented a setup that mirrors industry standards. It's not just about building something that works â€” it's about demonstrating how to build something that scales, adapts, and performs under real-world conditions. Here's a look at the architecture powering this project.
